// 2000. Reverse Prefix of Word
// Difficulty: ðŸŸ¢ Easy

/* 
Given a 0-indexed string word and a character ch, reverse the segment of word that starts at index 0 and ends at the index of the first occurrence of ch (inclusive). If the character ch does not exist in word, do nothing.
For example, if word = "abcdefd" and ch = "d", then you should reverse the segment that starts at 0 and ends at 3 (inclusive). The resulting string will be "dcbaefd".
Return the resulting string.
*/

// Examples:
// Example 1:
/* 
Input: word = "abcdefd", ch = "d"
Output: "dcbaefd"
Explanation: The first occurrence of "d" is at index 3. 
Reverse the part of word from 0 to 3 (inclusive), the resulting string is "dcbaefd".
*/

// Example 2:
/* 
Input: word = "xyxzxe", ch = "z"
Output: "zxyxxe"
Explanation: The first and only occurrence of "z" is at index 3.
Reverse the part of word from 0 to 3 (inclusive), the resulting string is "zxyxxe".
*/

// Example 3:
/* 
Input: word = "abcd", ch = "z"
Output: "abcd"
Explanation: "z" does not exist in word.
You should not do any reverse operation, the resulting string is "abcd".
*/

// Constraints:
/*
 * 1 <= word.length <= 250
 * word consists of lowercase English letters.
 * ch is a lowercase English letter.
 */

// Solutions

/**
 * @param {string} word
 * @param {character} ch
 * @return {string}
 */
